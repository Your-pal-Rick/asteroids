# asteroids
Third Boot.dev project
Made with Pygame and a lot of guidance.
Currently refactoring with OOP principles in mind.

Features:
* Controllable player ship
  * WASD: Fly and rotate
  * Space: Shoot
  * ESC: Exit game
* Randomly generated asteroids in 3 different sizes
* Circle-hitbox-based collisions
  * Shot hitting asteroid either splits into smaller sizes or destroys entirely
  * Ship hitting asteroid closes program
